# üñ•Ô∏è Mac Thermal Logger & Analyzer

This is a simple, effective CLI tool to monitor and analyze your Mac's thermal performance over time.

Perfect for diagnosing issues like `kernel_task` CPU spikes, thermal throttling, or sluggish performance under dev-heavy workflows (Docker, VSCode, Spotify, Chrome, etc.).

** Pro-Tip: Take your mac to the Genius Bar and have them clean our your mac's fans

## üîß What It Does
- Logs thermal data using `pmset` and `top`
- Captures CPU throttling & kernel_task load
- Automatically analyzes the log with Python when you stop the script
- Outputs warnings, CPU usage, and summary stats
- Optional: exports to CSV for long-term tracking
